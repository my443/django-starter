# SmallApp

A small Django app to let me explore and test some of the functionality. 

Some of the features that I want to see demonstrated are: 

[x] A page that is only viewable by selected users  
[ ] Data that is only visible to selected users  
[ ] The ability to update and change data only for selected users   
[ ] Ability to deploy this Django app to a managed server (eg Google App Engine, Azure App Services, etc.)
